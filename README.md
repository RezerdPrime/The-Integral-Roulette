# The Integral Roulette

$${The rules are simple: you are randomly given integrals and you calculate them. If you solve them, you press “\color{green}Solved”, otherwise you press “\color{red}Pass”.
You can customize the difficulty of the integrals that appear. You can read about the difficulties on the page itself under the “\color{lightblue}Integral \color{lightblue}List” tab.}$$
