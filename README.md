# The Integral Roulette

The rules are simple: you are randomly given integrals and you calculate them. If you solve them, you press “<span style="color:green">Solved</span>”, otherwise you press “<span style="color:red">Pass</span>”.
You can customize the difficulty of the integrals that appear. You can read about the difficulties on the page itself under the “<span style="color:blue">Integral List</span>” tab.
