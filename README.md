# The Integral Roulette

The rules are simple: you are randomly given integrals and you calculate them. If you solve them, you press “Solved”, otherwise you press “Pass”.

You can customize the difficulty of the integrals that appear. You can read about the difficulties on the page itself under the “Integral List” tab.

Roulette includes integrals personally selected by me, which I accumulated during two years of university studies. The distribution into groups by difficulty was made on the basis of the methods I found for calculating each integral. The list will be enlarged over time, but if you already have some suggestions, write to me in Discord: rezerdprime.

Good luck in challenging yourself!
